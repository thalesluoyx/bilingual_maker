# Introduction to Astronomy

Astronomy is the study of everything in the universe beyond Earth's atmosphere.

## Key Concepts

- **Black Hole**: A region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from it.
- **Red Shift**: The displacement of spectral lines toward longer wavelengths (the red end of the spectrum) in radiation from distant galaxies and celestial objects.
